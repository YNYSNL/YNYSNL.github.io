# üë©‚Äçüéì About Me 
I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in transportation engineering, guided by Prof. [Jian Sun](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm) at Tongji University. My research interests include human-robot interaction, autonomous driving and driving behavior modeling.

# üî• News
- *202407*  &nbsp; Our work "Towards Interactive Autonomous Vehicle Testing: Vehicle-Under-Test-Centered Traffic Simulation" has been accepted by IEEE ITSC 2024. I will be presenting this work at ITSC 2024 in Edmonton, Canada.[[paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02860v2)] [[code](https://github.com/YNYSNL/VCDI)]
- *202401*  &nbsp; We present our poster on "Modeling Social Interaction Behaviors and Measuring Driving Sociality in Strong Interactive Scenarios" at 2024 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting.

[Sociality Probe: Game-Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Modeling and Quantifying Social Patterns in Driving Interaction]([https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02860v1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10693867))

**Yiru Liu**, [Xiaocong Zhao\*](https://zxc-tju.github.io/), [Ye Tian\*](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1185.htm), [Jian Sun](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm)

- This research proposes a Game-Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GT-IRL) approach to quantify individualized sociality in driving interactions. Additionally, it reveals patterns of sociality across various scenarios, regions, and individuals, providing valuable insights into human-machine interactions.
